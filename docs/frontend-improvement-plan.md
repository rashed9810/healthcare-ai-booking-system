# Frontend Improvement Plan

## UI/UX Improvements

### 1. Theme Toggle Enhancement
- [ ] Add a more prominent theme toggle in the header
- [ ] Implement user preference persistence in localStorage
- [ ] Add system preference detection
- [ ] Ensure all components have proper styling for both light and dark modes

### 2. Language Localization
- [ ] Complete Bengali translations for all UI strings
- [ ] Implement date/time formatting based on locale
- [ ] Add number formatting based on locale
- [ ] Test all forms and error messages in both languages
- [ ] Consider adding more languages in the future

### 3. Form Validation & Feedback
- [ ] Implement real-time validation for all forms
- [ ] Add loading states for all form submissions
- [ ] Implement inline error messages
- [ ] Add success messages and transitions
- [ ] Implement form accessibility improvements (ARIA attributes)

### 4. Responsive Design
- [ ] Implement a hamburger menu for mobile devices
- [ ] Optimize layout for tablets and small screens
- [ ] Test on various device sizes
- [ ] Ensure touch targets are appropriately sized
- [ ] Implement responsive typography

## Functional Enhancements

### 1. Interactive Symptom Checker
- [ ] Implement a step-by-step symptom questionnaire
- [ ] Add branching logic based on user responses
- [ ] Implement urgency scoring algorithm
- [ ] Add visual indicators for urgency levels
- [ ] Implement recommendation engine for next steps

### 2. Video Consultation Optimization
- [ ] Implement WebRTC with ICE servers
- [ ] Add adaptive bitrate streaming
- [ ] Implement bandwidth detection
- [ ] Add fallback to audio-only mode for low bandwidth
- [ ] Implement connection quality indicators

### 3. Kiosk Mode
- [ ] Implement keyboard shortcuts for common actions
- [ ] Add large touch-friendly buttons
- [ ] Disable browser context menus
- [ ] Implement auto-logout for security
- [ ] Add screen reader support

## Code Quality Improvements

### 1. Component Refactoring
- [ ] Extract reusable form components
- [ ] Create a component library for common UI elements
- [ ] Implement consistent prop interfaces
- [ ] Add storybook documentation
- [ ] Implement component testing

### 2. State Management
- [ ] Refine React Context usage
- [ ] Consider implementing Recoil for complex state

- [ ] Create centralized error handling service
- [ ] Add error logging
- [ ] Implement graceful degradation
- [ ] Add retry mechanisms for failed API calls

## Implementation Priority

### High Priority (Next 2 Weeks)
1. Form validation & feedback
2. Responsive design improvements
3. Error handling implementation

### Medium Priority (3-4 Weeks)
1. Theme toggle enhancement
2. Language localization completion
3. Component refactoring

### Lower Priority (5-8 Weeks)
1. Interactive symptom checker
2. Video consultation optimization
3. Kiosk mode implementation

## Technical Debt to Address
1. Hydration errors in server components
2. Inconsistent state management approaches
3. Missing type definitions
4. Incomplete test coverage
5. Accessibility issues
